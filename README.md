## About

In this project you will find scripts to handle knowledge bases in Tabtree, including:
* Reorder items
* Parse web resources of data and save it into Tabtree format
* Generate wiki markup for [transhumanism.online](https://transhumanism.online) and other outlets

Scripts for each sort of tasks are located in the separate directories, together with settings files `settings.tree`, that define filepaths, sources of data and "*such much*"
